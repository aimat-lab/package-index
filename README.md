# aimat-lab.github.io/package-index
Public package index for the AIMat Lab.  
To install packages you need to have an ssh key for github setup on your system. Due to 2FA it is not possible anymore to serve packages via https.  
You can install packages from here using:
```
pip install <package_name> --extra-index-url https://aimat-lab.github.io/package-index/
```
